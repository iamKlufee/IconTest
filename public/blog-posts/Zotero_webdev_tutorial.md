# Master Cross-Platform Zotero Synchronization with WebDAV: Your Ultimate Guide
Are you tired of juggling different versions of your research papers and annotations across your devices? This comprehensive guide will show you how to achieve seamless Zotero cross-platform sync using WebDAV. Whether you're on Windows, macOS, iOS, or Android, this method ensures your entire Zotero library, including PDFs and annotations, is always up-to-date and accessible. We'll use Infinicloud as our example, but the principles apply to any WebDAV-compatible cloud storage.

## Why WebDAV for Zotero Sync?
While Zotero offers its own sync service, using WebDAV provides greater control and flexibility, especially if you have existing cloud storage or need more space than Zotero's free tier offers. It's a robust, standard protocol for file transfer, making it ideal for synchronizing large research libraries.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your WebDAV-Compatible Cloud Storage
First, you'll need a cloud storage service that supports WebDAV. Popular choices include Infinicloud, Dropbox, and Google Drive (though Google Drive may require a third-party bridge or specific configuration). For this tutorial, we'll use Infinicloud due to its generous free storage.

1. Log in to your Infinicloud account and navigate to your My Page.

2. Find the Apps Connection section.

3. Enable Apps Connection by ticking the box.

4. Click Issue in the Apps Password column. A unique password will be generated.

- CRITICAL: Copy and securely store this password. It's displayed only once. If you lose it, you'll need to reissue a new one, which means re-entering it in all your connected Zotero instances.

## Step 2: Configuring Zotero Desktop Sync (Windows/macOS)
With your WebDAV credentials ready, let's set up your desktop Zotero:

1. Open Zotero on your computer.

2. Go to Settings (or Preferences on macOS).

3. Click on the Sync tab.

4. Under File Syncing, select WebDAV from the dropdown menu (or check the box for "Sync attachment files in My Library using WebDAV").

5. nter the following details from your cloud storage's My Page:
- WebDAV Connection URL
- Connection ID (often your username or email)
- App Password (the one you just generated)

6. Click Verify Server. A "Server configuration verified" message confirms a successful setup.

## Step 3: Syncing Zotero on Your Android Device
Setting up Zotero Android WebDAV sync is just as straightforward:

1. Open the Zotero app on your Android device.

2. Go to Libraries and tap the gear icon (Settings) in the top right.

4. Input the same WebDAV details:
- WebDAV Connection URL
- Connection ID
- App Password

5. Tap Verify Server. A "Verified" message indicates your Android Zotero is now synced via WebDAV.

## Step 4: Cross-Platform Syncing for All Your Devices
Once you've completed these steps, your Zotero library is set up for WebDAV synchronization across multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. This means your research, notes, and annotations will be consistent everywhere.

Pro Tip for Researchers: To ensure your annotations and notes are perfectly synced across all devices, use Zotero's built-in PDF reader. This guarantees that your markups are preserved and visible regardless of the platform you're using.

By leveraging WebDAV, you unlock a powerful, flexible, and cost-effective way to manage your academic research.
