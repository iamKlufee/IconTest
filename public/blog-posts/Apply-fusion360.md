# How to Get Fusion 360 for Free: Your Guide to the Community Version (Perfect for 3D Printing on Mac!)
In the world of research and prototyping, having the right tools is crucial. For many of us, this means DIYing equipment, and that's where 3D printing becomes indispensable. If you're a Mac user, you might know that finding robust, free 3D CAD software can be a challenge. Windows has a plethora of options, but macOS users often feel left behind.

That's why I'm excited to share my experience with Fusion 360. It's a powerful and smooth-running 3D CAD software that I've found to be exceptionally user-friendly on macOS. What's even better is that it also fully supports Windows users.

This blog post is your step-by-step guide to obtaining the free community version of Fusion 360. While this version has some functional limitations compared to its professional counterparts, for 3D printing needs, it's more than adequate. Weâ€™ll walk you through the application process so you can start designing and printing without breaking the bank.
